# mark-my-words

Mark My Words (MMW) is a multi-agent writing system built on Claude Code. It orchestrates a set of specialized agents — researcher, strategist, writer, critic, publisher — through a structured workflow to produce blog posts for [alexandrebrisebois.github.io](https://alexandrebrisebois.github.io/).

## How to run the build

Point Claude Code at the build prompt:

```
prompts/mmw-build-prompt.md
```

This builds the full project scaffold, all agent files, and supporting docs from the specs in `prompts/specs/`.

## Spec structure

All build specs live in `prompts/specs/`. Each file is independently editable.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `specs/flow.md` | Workflow, phases, protocols, file schema, constraints |
| `specs/agent-caret.md` | Caret — orchestrator + writer |
| `specs/agent-mark.md` | Mark — brand + voice |
| `specs/agent-compass.md` | Compass — strategist |
| `specs/agent-devil.md` | Devil — critique |
| `specs/agent-turing.md` | Turing — research |
| `specs/agent-echo.md` | Echo — audience |
| `specs/agent-press.md` | Press — publisher |
| `specs/agent-prism.md` | Prism — visual brand |
| `specs/agent-index.md` | Index — archivist |
| `specs/agent-cadence.md` | Cadence — scheduler |

## Making changes

- **Add a new agent**: create `specs/agent-newname.md`, add it to the tool scoping table in `mmw-build-prompt.md`, rebuild that agent.
- **Change a phase or protocol**: edit `specs/flow.md` only. Agent specs reference it but don't own it.
- **Change an agent's behavior**: edit `specs/agent-X.md` only, then rebuild that one agent from its spec.
- **Rebuild a single agent**: tell Claude Code to read `specs/agent-X.md` and regenerate `.claude/agents/X.md`.
